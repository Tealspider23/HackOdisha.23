## About The Project

<img src="public/images/a-planet-being-terraformed-in-2d-anime-style-logo-542875197.png" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">

Creating a machine learning model to predict the habitability of a planet based on satellite data is a complex and ambitious task. It would require a substantial amount of data and expertise in various fields, including astrophysics, geology, and machine learning. Below, I'll outline a high-level approach and suggest some Python libraries and models that could be used as a starting point.

1. *Data Collection*:
   - Gather data about exoplanets and their characteristics, such as distance from their host star, size, atmosphere composition, and more. NASA's Exoplanet Archive is a valuable source for such data.

2. *Feature Engineering*:
   - Extract relevant features from the satellite data. These features might include information about the planet's environment, such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, surface composition, and more.

3. *Data Preprocessing*:
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.

4. *Labeling*:
   - Define a suitable target variable or label that represents the habitability of planets. You may need to consult experts in the field to create a meaningful label.

5. *Model Selection*:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model. Given the complexity of the problem, ensemble methods and deep learning architectures like neural networks may be suitable. Some Python libraries to consider include:
     - Scikit-Learn: For traditional machine learning algorithms.
     - TensorFlow or PyTorch: For deep learning models.
     
6. *Model Training*:
   - Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train your chosen model on the training data.

7. *Model Evaluation*:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and possibly domain-specific metrics related to habitability.

8. *Hyperparameter Tuning*:
   - Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

9. *Interpretability and Visualization*:
   - Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret and explain model predictions.
   - Visualize the results to gain insights into the factors affecting habitability predictions.

10. *Deployment*:
    - Once you have a satisfactory model, you can deploy it as a web service or integrate it into other applications for real-world use.

11. *Continuous Monitoring and Improvement*:
    - Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as new data becomes available or as you gather more insights.

Keep in mind that creating a model for planet habitability is a complex task and may require collaboration with experts in astronomy and planetary science. Additionally, it's crucial to have a substantial and high-quality dataset to train a reliable model. This is a broad and ongoing research area, and the success of such a model would depend on the quality of data and domain knowledge integrated into the model's design.
